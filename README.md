# Todoey
The iOS App in UIKit for Data Persistent

# Important Points:
- Data persistency through NSCoder (For checking the implementation of NSCoder, please select the branch 'Persistence-through-NSCoder')
- Data persistence through CoreData (For checking the implementation of NSCoder, please select the branch 'Persistence-through-CoreData')
    - Performing CRUD
    - Adding relationship to entities
    - Querying through NSPredicate
- Data persistence through Realm
    - Use of dynamic variable (the declaration modifier, tells the runtime to use dynamic dispatch instead of static dispatch. This will allow the property to be monitored for any change at     
      runtime while your app is running. for example, when the app is running, then that allows realm ro dynamically update those changes in the database)
    - Create one to many relationship with the help of List<>
    - Create the inverse relationship with the help of LinkingObjects (LinkingObjects are auto updating containers that represents zero or more objects that are linked to its owning model object 
      through  a property relationship. Its simply defining the inverse relationship)
    - Performing CRUD
    - Querying
